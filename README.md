How To Play:
-------------
 The game consists of a ball that falls towards the center of a ring. The ring is made up of four segments that are different colors. If you tap on the right half of the screen you will rotate
 the ring clockwise and if you tap on the left half of the screen the ring will rotate anti-clockwise. Your goal is to make the ball fall onto the segment that matches it's own color. If you 
 fail to do so you lose the game. If you do match the colors then the ball will reset it's position and choose a new color and you will gain one point. Repeat this process attempting to get
 a higher score each time.

Controls:
----------
 Tap on the right side of the screen = rotate ring clockwise 
 
 Tap on the left side of the screen  = rotate ring anti-clockwise
